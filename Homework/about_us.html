            Named after the famous London painter, Jack Chambers School was built in 1992. It is a first-class educational facility housing 2 gymnasiums with a seating capacity of 800, a lunchroom facility, a music room and a childcare centre through the London Children's Connection (519-850-0744).

            <br><br>

            A new 8 classroom addition was opened in November of 2006 in order to accommodate the growing population of the Jack Chambers community. All of the classrooms are equipped with SmartBoard technology. The Jack Chambers School facility is used extensively every day of the week, providing before and after school childcare programs, and community-based programs through the City on London in the evenings for children and adults. The Jack Chambers staff prides itself in offering a balanced educational program for our students in the areas of academics, athletics and the arts.</p>
